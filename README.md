# zkSNARKS_notes

## What?

Eplorations of various zero knowledge protocols.
These notes are mainly based on the books "Pairing for Beginners" by Craig Costello, the "MoonMath" and "Elliptic curves : number theory and cryptography" by Lawrence Washington.
There are Sage examples to go along with the notes, as well as maxima script when calculations go beyond pen-and-paper.

## Why?

The aim of keepig these notes is twofold:
- to have a set of notes for a self-study, quick-reference and a refresher of basic concepts.
- a scrapbook of quick implementations.

## Todo

I fully intend to clean these notes up
